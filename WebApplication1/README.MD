This Project was Created in MVC Core. It is a program that sorts and filters reviews based on user input. I made this app using .NET version 6. It uses Entity Framework Core to create Relational Database. 
The way this program works is that I have 1 Controller to manage the logic of the app, 1 View to display the data, and 1 model which is stored in database and displayed on the view.
To start the program you must first download the Zip file, then extract it, after extracting it you have to open it with Visual Studio. Next you go to Tools
