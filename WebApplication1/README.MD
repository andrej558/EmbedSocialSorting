This Project was Created in MVC Core. It is a program that sorts and filters reviews based on user input. I made this app using .NET version 6. It uses Entity Framework Core to create Relational Database.<br/>
The way this program works is that I have 1 Controller to manage the logic of the app, 1 View to display the data, and 1 model which is stored in database and displayed on the view.<br/>
To start the program you must first download the Zip file, then extract it, after extracting it you have to open it with Visual Studio. <br/>
Next you go to Tools
